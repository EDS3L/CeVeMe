            **Additional Instructions:**
            - The entire content of the JSON response must be in Polish.
            - Do not invent or add any information not provided in the 'CANDIDATE DATA' and 'JOB OFFER' sections.
            - If, based on best practices and the analysis of the job offer, certain sections are not relevant or should be omitted, leave them empty in the JSON object (e.g., use empty arrays for lists or empty strings for strings).

            ## Rules for Generating the CV (update for 2024/2025)

            ### Fundamental Principles
            - **Zero Hallucination:** Base solely on the facts provided by the candidate in the 'CANDIDATE DATA' section
            - **Maximum Matching:** Analyze the job offer and use its keywords, prioritize skills based on skill-based hiring
            - **Strategic Tailoring:** Every element of the CV must be tailored to the specific job offer
            - **Clean JSON Format:** Return only a correctly formatted JSON object
            - **Minimalist Design:** In line with 2025 trends, avoid excessive creativity
            - **Quality over Quantity:** Focus on the most relevant and impactful information rather than overwhelming with excessive details. Include only essential elements that directly support the candidate's application for the specific position.

            ### CRITICAL RULE: Integrity in Assigning Technologies and Skills
            - **Absolute Source of Truth:** Your absolute priority is integrity. Technical skills, technologies, tools, libraries, and any other competencies may be included in the CV **only and exclusively** if the candidate has **explicitly** listed them in the `CANDIDATE DATA` section.
            - **The Role of the Job Offer:** The `JOB OFFER` section is to be used **solely** for **prioritizing and highlighting** the skills that the candidate **already possesses**. It is not a source from which you can infer and assign new, unmentioned competencies to the candidate.
            - **Example of INCORRECT behavior:** If the job offer requires 'Spring Boot', but the candidate's data only lists 'Java', **YOU ARE FORBIDDEN** to add 'Spring Boot' to their skills. You must base your response solely on what the candidate has provided.
            - **No Inference Rule:** Avoid any assumptions or inferences about technologies. If something is not explicitly stated in the candidate's data, for the purpose of this task, it does not exist.

            ### Content Optimization in Line with 2024/2025 Trends

            #### Summary (3-4 sentences, 50-70 words)
            - Start with the role + years of experience in the key field from the job offer
            - List 2-3 most important skills/technologies required in the offer
            - **MANDATORY:** Add 1-2 quantified achievements from the candidate's experience
            - Conclude with a sentence linking competencies to the company's goals mentioned in the offer

            #### Skills (skill-based hiring - 2025 trend)
            - Group into logical categories according to the priority of requirements in the job offer
            - Format: "Skill1 • Skill2 • Skill3"
            - Priority: technical skills, soft skills, languages, certifications
            - **New in 2025:** Add a "Core Competencies" section under the summary
            - **Key:** Use exactly the same terms as in the job offer
            - **Selective Inclusion:** Include only skills that are relevant to the position and explicitly mentioned by the candidate

            #### Experience (quantification of achievements - key trend)
            - **40% higher chance of recruiter interest** through quantification
            - Each point = achievement (not duty)
            - Strong action verbs (Optimized, Increased, Managed)
            - **STAR method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
            - **Matching:** Highlight achievements that best match the offer's requirements
            - **Focused Content:** Include only the most relevant work experiences that demonstrate competencies required for the target position
            - Examples of quantification:
              - "Increased efficiency by 30%"
              - "Managed an 8-person team"
              - "Reduced process time by 2 hours daily"
              - "Achieved 120% of sales target"

            #### Projects
            - **Strategic Selection:** Include only projects that demonstrate skills and competencies directly relevant to the job offer
            - **Quality Focus:** 2-3 well-described, impactful projects are better than a long list of minor ones
            - **Relevance Priority:** Choose projects that best showcase the candidate's ability to excel in the target role

            #### Education & Certificates
            - Concise and to the point
            - For experienced candidates: low priority
            - Certificates: only current and relevant to the role
            - **Selective Approach:** Include only educational background and certifications that add value to the specific application

            #### GDPR Clause
            - **Polish:** "Wyrażam zgodę na przetwarzanie moich danych osobowych zawartych w ofercie pracy dla potrzeb niezbędnych do realizacji procesu rekrutacji zgodnie z Rozporządzeniem Parlamentu Europejskiego i Rady (UE) 2016/679 z dnia 27 kwietnia 2016 r."

            ### ATS Optimization (2024/2025)

            #### Keywords
            - **Identification:** Find key words in the job offer
            - **Integration:** Use naturally throughout the CV
            - **Avoid:** Keyword stuffing

            ### Content Curation Philosophy (2025 Best Practices)

            **Remember:** Professional CV writing is about strategic selection, not exhaustive listing. Every piece of information included must serve a purpose in demonstrating the candidate's fit for the specific role. Recruiters spend an average of 7 seconds on initial CV screening - make every word count by including only the most compelling and relevant information.

            ### Verification Process Before Returning JSON

            - [ ] All data comes exclusively from the 'CANDIDATE DATA' section (zero hallucination)
            - [ ] CV strategically tailored to keywords from the 'JOB OFFER'

            - [ ] Summary contains elements directly responding to the job offer
            - [ ] At least 70% of experience points are quantified achievements
            - [ ] JSON format 100% correct and compliant with the schema
            - [ ] GDPR clause included in Polish
            - [ ] STAR method applied in experience descriptions

            - [ ] Content curated for maximum impact - quality over quantity principle applied
            - [ ] Only relevant and essential information included

            ### Language Standards (2024/2025)

            #### Polish
            - Professional, natural language
            - Strong action verbs
            - Consistent date formatting

            ### Additional Tips for 2025

            1. **Remote work trend:** Highlight remote work skills if relevant
            2. **AI and automation:** Include knowledge of AI tools if applicable
            3. **Sustainability:** Add ESG-related projects if relevant
            4. **Diversity & Inclusion:** Subtle mentions if fitting the company culture
            5. **Continuous learning:** Emphasize recent courses/certifications

            **REMEMBER:** The response is only a clean JSON - no additional comments, explanations, or questions!
